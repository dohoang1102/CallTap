CallTap (or ClickToCall before I found out there was already a tweak with such name)

Idea by both 'Muhammet Ilendemli' and 'Nimrod Goldmann'. The 'Swipe to call' feature, as proposed by the second could not be implemented due to overcomplication, probable issues and even a logical incompatibility with OneByOne Contacts.

Not as easy to code as it initially looked! :P
